##About#

This project is based on a Basic Cucumber-JVM + Selenium WebDriver test automation framework [posted](https://automatictester.co.uk/2015/06/11/basic-cucumberjvm-selenium-webdriver-test-automation-framework/) by automatic tester on June 11, 2015. for integrating cucumber-jvm and Testng.  This project is part of the plan to extend cucumber-testng to see how far the technology can be pushed.

Out of the box, the automatictester framework runs two test runner classes in parallel. TestNG also supports running test methods in parallel.
